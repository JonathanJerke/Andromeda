Andromeda is an advance of Quantum Dynamics technologies, i.e. Sums of Products, 
into an area of electronic structure using the Gaussian-Sinc method for development of
interactions.  




Added commands to build runtime in each species subdirectory.
New distributed programming can effectively compute Lithum in normal super computer.
v9.0 has been tested extensively and the code is much more readable.
v9.1 has cut the pork and now can easily allocate my systems of choice.
v9.2 has implemented HDF5 because I had a huge IO issue.
v9.3 has sped up and or avoided various slow procedures.

See (Count Down) on WIKI.
