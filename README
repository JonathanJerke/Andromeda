Andromeda advances Quantum Dynamics technologies, i.e. Sums of Products, 
to electronic and other fundamental interactions.  

v9.0 has been tested extensively and the code is much more readable.
v9.1 has cut the pork and now can easily allocate my systems of choice.
v9.2 has implemented HDF5 because I had a huge IO issue.
v9.3 has sped up and or avoided various slow procedures.
v9.4 has sped up the core ALS routine by many orders and parallelized the Matrix-vector product.
v9.6 has added Python via cythonization routines which are in andromedaPy.
v9.7 has added a compression algorthms, which is much like SVD in some cases.  The GTO interface was also added.
v9.8 has added periodic boundary conditions with more flexiable 2-body operator structure, similar work was done on spatial boundary conditions.
v9.9 has spiffed up interface with python and other considerations/ also give path to demonstrate basic operator value.
