Added Symmetrized Gaussians as an arbitary basis sized foundation.

The new bootup can start at any basis size, the foundation^(Dim+1) vectors will automatically be created in any basis size.
Same as usual to run, but summa.sh is more useful now, as it significantly accelerates this potent foundations.

cp your favorate D's from commands to summa in working directory and execute summa.sh, like pathFinder, it will forge a path, this time, summa-ing all D's in summa.

summa.sh takes two inputs,  previous and next folder, while creating the next folder.
PathFinder.sh will stage off the results naturally, of course.

Study FlashHelium for a vision of future buildout .  

With this, one can START with L in the hundreds, avoiding costly --and slow-- staging operations from small Ls'.
